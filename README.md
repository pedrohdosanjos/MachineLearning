# Severity Prediction from Vital Signs

This project aims to predict patient severity based on vital signs such as **blood pressure quality**, **pulse**, and **respiration**. The approach involves building a machine learning model, specifically a neural network, to classify input data into different levels of severity.

## Description

The model was developed to:

1. **Predict continuous severity** of patients based on vital signs.
2. **Classify severity** into 4 distinct classes, based on predefined severity intervals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - **TensorFlow / Keras** (for building and training neural networks)
  - **scikit-learn** (for data handling and evaluation metrics)
  - **pandas** (for reading and manipulating data)
  - **numpy** (for numerical operations)
  - **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (for result visualization)
